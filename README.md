I had created a website based on a travel theme. The website is called "TravelBloom" and it allows users to search for travel destinations based.

You can search this places for example :

1. Banff National Park
2. Niagara Falls
3. CN Tower
4. Prince Edward Island
5. Montmorency Falls

I had added  a feature to the website that allows users to search for destinations based on their interests.


Project Details :

There are 3 main folders :

1. Data folder :

In the data folder, there is a data.json file.  This file contains a list of travel destinations with their details.

2. Public folder :

In this file, there is a folder of images, a script.js file, and styles.css.

The script.js file contains the JavaScript code for the website. The styles.css file contains the CSS styles

3. Views folder :

In this folder,  there is one file named as index.html

4. Server.js file :

This  file contains the server side code for the website.

Other are the files for the node modules.

Using node we can run this files and access data.
